Authors: Xiaoyan Zhang (xiz115@ucsd.edu), Kay Qu(kqu@ucsd.edu)

# About this project
This is a paired EDA project which is originally assigned by UCSD's DSC80 offering during SP23. 
we will be focusing on cleaning, exploreing, and building a scikit pipeline to tranform and predict data originally scraped from [food.com](food.com). 
More information about the project's guidelines can be found [here](https://dsc80.com/project5/#overview).

# Part I: Analysis

## Prediction Problem

Follwoing up on our previous investigation on **the relationship between Time (in minutues) to prepare a recipe and whether it correlates with the average rating that the recipe receives.** We hypothesize that the longer time a recipe requires, the less rating it will receive. However, we could not establish a clear correlation between them, therefore we would like to build a **multiclass classification model** to predict recipes' ratings.

The metric we will be using to assess our model is (TBD)


## About our data
Our data is derived from [food.com](https://www.food.com), originally scraped and used by them. The raw csv files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kIbMz6jlhleiZ9_3QthmUnifoSds_2EI/view).

Below are the breif description of the raw data that we are going to perform cleaning on: 

### raw_recipes (83782 rows, 12 columns)

| 'minutes'        | Time (in minutues) to prepare recipe                            |

| 'nutrition'      | Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| 'n_steps'        | Number of steps in recipe                            |
| 'steps'          | Description for 'n_steps', in order                       |
| 'description'    | additional description provided by user                             |

### raw_ratings (731927 rows, 5 columns)

| Column       | Description           |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 'user_id'    | User's ID               |
| 'recipe_id'  | Recipe's ID             |
| 'date'       | Date when the rating was posted   |
| 'rating'     | rating, scaling from 1-5          |
